# CS50 explained for non programmers

As a non-computer science background myself, I took the CS50x to start
in the world of CS, this repo its not going to have all the solutions of
each problem sets in the CS50x course, there are already a lot of repos
with the code to the solutions, my goal its to teach myself -and you-
the key concepts that CS50 introduce form the perspective form someone
with no programming o computer science background.

I hope who ever read and use this repo to find it helpful and fun! :)

# Structure

Im going to structure this repo with the topics of the classes rather
for each problem set, my goal its not to put the solutions in code of
each pset, its more to guide whats its the problem set teaching and
the relation with the topic of the class.

# Special Thanks to David, Doug and Brian!

Thanks to all of you for the great teachings

## Disclaimer

As I say, Im not going to give the code of the solutions there are
plenty of that repos, my goal is to explain core concepts for people
with no CS background like my self.

If you are coursing the CS50 remember the the code of honesty! you can
ask for help o guidance but not just copy the solutions there is not
point in doing that if you what to learn.

## Have fun!
